Coding Methods:
//Various important things I came across while coding.

 ALWAYS DO THIS:Declare variables with 0.
 Use bits/stdc++.h wherever required.
 Write code in manageable manner.
 Divide and Conquer.
 Use long data type when required.
 Use vectors,sets and maps as required.
 Always use cin.ignore() before taking a string.
 Always, Always check for increment and decrement values.
 Use getline(cin,str); or scanf("%[^\n]s",str); for taking entire lines.
 Use memset(array,value,n*sizeof(array[0])) for initializing arrays.
 Always check for base cases.
 Manage any exception in code i.e. Divide by 0 or Segmentation Fault.
Avoid using recursive function for large numbers.
